# This is my GIT learning repository!

**My rotation:**
    1. touch [file]
    2. git status
    3. git add [file]
    4. git status
    5. git commit -m "[Message]"
    6. git pull (This is the good style, right?)
    7. git push (origin master neccessary?)

**Comments**
    1. Steps 2 and 4 are used for learning purposes - to visually see if I haven't missed something.

    2. Step 6. Pull before you push because somebody may have already uploaded a new code.

    3. Step 7 command works without any arguments, possible causes:
        * I am on the master branch already
        * git automatically sees that it's my only branch of the project so it knows what to do

**Things to test/learn:**
    - Branches - create, edit, delete
    - Changes to commits (local and remote)
    - Explore GitHub's functions (Issues, etc)
    - More
